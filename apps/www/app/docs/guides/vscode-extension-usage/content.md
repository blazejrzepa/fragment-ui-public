title: VS Code Extension
description: Set up the Fragment UI extension in VS Code.
---

The Fragment UI VS Code extension streamlines development with Fragment UI by adding autocomplete, hover docs, and snippets.

## Install

- **Marketplace**: coming soon.
- **From source**: the extension source currently lives in the main `fragment-ui` monorepo (not in `fragment-ui-public`).

## What you get

- Component name autocomplete
- Hover docs (links to docs pages)
- Snippets for common components

## Tips

- Keep a `registry.json` / `/r/*.json` available for quick installs via shadcn.
- Use token-based styling (`var(--color-...)`, `var(--space-...)`) so code works across themes.
