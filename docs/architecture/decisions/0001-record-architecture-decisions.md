# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Deciders:** Architecture Team

---

## Context

We need to document architectural decisions to:
- Understand why decisions were made
- Avoid revisiting settled decisions
- Onboard new team members
- Maintain consistency

---

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard in [this article](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADRs will be stored in `docs/architecture/decisions/` with format:
- Numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Markdown format
- Status tracking (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)

---

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of decisions
- Easy to find and reference
- Consistent format

### Negative
- Requires discipline to maintain
- May become outdated if not updated
