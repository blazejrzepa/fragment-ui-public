# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it via:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred): Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on the [Security tab](https://github.com/blazejrzepa/fragment-ui/security)
- **Email**: security@fragment-ui.dev

We will respond as soon as possible and work on a fix.

## Security Updates

- Critical security vulnerabilities will be patched immediately
- Non-critical security issues will be addressed in the next planned release
- All security fixes will be documented in release notes

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- ✅ Public Design System packages (`@fragment_ui/ui`, `@fragment_ui/tokens`, `@fragment_ui/blocks`)
